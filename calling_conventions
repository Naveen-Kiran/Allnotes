Calling Conventions:
-------------------
	Calling conventions specifies:

		1. How args are passed to a function.
		2. How return values are passed back out of a function.
		3. How the function is called.
		4. How the function is managed its stack in stack frame.

	In-short, the calling conventions specifies how a function call in c/c++ is converted to assembly language.

	There are 3 calling conventions:
		1.stdcall
		2.cdecall
		3.fastcall

	NOTE :
		-> Default calling convention is "cdecall" for linux and windows.

		-> caller : calls the function.i.e function which called.
		
		-> calle: Calle is the function getting called by caller.

	cdecall:

		In "cdecall" subroutine args are passed on the stack right to left.

	sdtcall:

		In "stdcall" subroutine args are passed on the stack left to right.
