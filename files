FIles:
-----
There are 2 types of files.

1.Text files(.txt)

2.Binary files(.bin)

	Binary files:
	------------
		 contain 0's and 1's.
	
	Operations on files:
	-------------------	
	1. Opening an existing file. 		fopen(filename,mode) returns fptr

	2. Creating a new file.        		fopen(filenname,mode) return fptr

	3. Closing a file.             		fclose(fptr)

	4. Creating and writing on a file. 	fprintf,fscanf

	The data type of file is "FILE".

	MODES:
	-----
	r    : 
		open for reading.
	rb   : 
		open for reading in binary mode.

	NOTE : 
	       When there is no file existing, when a given mode is r/rb then it will return NULL.

	w/wb : 
		open for writing normal/binary mode.

	NOTE : 
	       If file exists 
			contents will be deleted 
	       else
			new file will be created.
	a/ab :
		open in append mode and data is added to the end of file.
	
	NOTE : 
		If file doesnot exits file will be created.
	
	r+/rb+:
		open for both reading and writing.
	
	w+/wb+:
		open for both reading and writing.
	
	a+/ab+:
		open for both reading and appending.

	BINARY FILES:
	------------
		fread() and fwrite() are used for reading and writing on the binary files.

	fread(address,size,numbers,*fptr);

	fwrite(address,size,numbers,*fptr);



RANDOM ACCESS IN FILES:
----------------------

	C supports 3 functions for random accessing on files.
	
	1.fseek
	2.ftell
	3.rewind
	
	1.fseek():
		It is used to move the file pointer to a specific position.
	
		syntax : 
			int fseek(fptr,offset,position);
	
		position defines the point with respect to which the file pointer to be moved.
		there are 3 vlaues.
			SEEK_END : denotes end of file.
			SEEK_SET : deontes starting of the file.
			SEEK_CUR : denotes current file pointer position.
	2.ftell():
		A function ftell() returns the value of current pointer positoin in the file
			Ex: ftell(fptr);

	3. rewind():
		It is used to move the file pointer to the beginning of given file.
		 	Ex : rewind(fptr);
