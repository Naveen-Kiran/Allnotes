	when we execute "hello" executable in the pwd(whereas "./hello" will run).

	it will not execute since its path is not present in "echo $PATH"

	but while executing (ls, pwd,....), it will execute since there paths are located in "echo $PATH".

	So to add present path to $PATH:
	
		PATH=$PATH:pathname

	now we can run the excutables.

To tell compiler not to remove tempory files:
--------------------------------------------
		$gcc --save-temps hello.c

	it will produce all intermediate files like 
		
		hello.i hello.o hello.s hello
