Terminals can display text in color as well as allow formatting with the help of escape sequences.
	Escape sequence = escape character + format code + 'm' => "escape[formatcodem"
	
	escape character can be \e, \033 or \x1
	
	format code for RED is 31
	
	To print text in RED 
			echo -e "\e[31mhelloworld"

	To reset color in formatting, format code is 0
			echo -e "\e[0m"
