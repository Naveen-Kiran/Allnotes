Static library:
--------------

	A library is a collection of fucntions/variables, which we can call from our program.
	
	The advantage of library is "Re-usaability" and "Time saving".
	
	When a static libary is linked, the code is fully copied in the linking stage.

	By convention/standard, the static libray will have a prefix "lib" and suffix ".a"
	
		Ex: libprint.a

Steps to create a static Library:
----------------------------------

	1. Compile the c code to Object code using

			gcc -c *.c
	
	2. Then we can use object code to generate static lib using GNU "ar" command.
	   {ar stands for archiever}
	
			ar -rc libprint.a *.o

		whereas,
			r -> replace any older file
			c -> create an arcieve

	3. To use static lib 
	
			gcc main.c -o main -L. lprint
	
				here -L. will tell linker to kook for libraries in current  directory.

			Otherway is :

				export LIBRARY_PATH=.
		
				gcc main.c -o main -lprint
		
	To view Library paths:
	---------------------
			echo $LIBRARY_PATH

Disadvantages:
-------------

	If the lib code is updated,we have to recompile your program into new executable.

	Every program in the system that uses static lib contains a copy in its executable.

Advantages:
----------
	No dependencies.

	i.e .. we can run the binary into other machine without having specific libraries installed.
