Mixed mode :
----------

	1. whenever operation is performed between "signed int" and "unsigned int",	
	   the "signed int" is converted to "unsigned".

	2. whenever an operation is performed between "int" and "float", 
	   the "int" is converted to "float".
	
	3. whenever an operation is performed on type smaller than "int",i.e...(char,short)
	   they will be promoted to "int".

	NOTE:
	All above is done to avoid accidental overflows during arithmetic operations.
