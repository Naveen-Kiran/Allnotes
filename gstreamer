GSTREAMER:
---------
-->It is a development framework for creating applications like media player, video editor, streaming media broadcaster and so on.

-->Gstreamer is a set of libraries and plugins that can be used to implement various multimedia applications ranging from 
   Desktop players, Audio-Video recorders, Multimedia servers, Trancoders ...etc.

-->Applications are built by constructing a pipeline composed of elements.

To install gstreamer :
--------------------
	sudo apt-get install gstreamer-tools

what is a Pipeline ?
------------------
-->It is a collection of elements.

-->Applications are built by constructing a pipeline composed of elements.

	
what is an Element ?
------------------
-->Element is an object which performs some action on a multimedia stream.

-->Element is a most important class of objects in gstreamer.

-->You will usually create a chain of elements linked together and let data flow through this chain of elements.

-->An element has one specific function. 
   such as, 
	-->Capture from a hardware device.
		 Ex : camera, microphone.
	
	-->Render (display) to a hardware device.
		 Ex : speaker, lcd display.
	
	-->Decode and Encode between formats.
	
	-->Mix multiple streams.

	-->Reading a file.
	
-->Elements have input and output pads called "Sink pad" and "Source pad".

-->Data flows from one element source pad to the another element sink pad.
	
-->Application links elements together on pads to construct a pipeline.

-->A sink element has only sink pad and source element has only source pad.
	
What is a Pad ?
-------------
-->Pads are elements input and output, where you connect other elements.

-->They are used to negotiate links and data flow between elements in gstreamer. 

-->A pad is a connection point between element.

-->Source pad provides data.

-->Sink pad consumes data.
	
	
What is Downstream and Upstream ?
-------------------------------
-->Downstream and Upstream are used to describe direction in the pipeline.
		From Source to Sink   is called "Downstream".
		From Sink   to Source is called "Upstream".

Command line Tools :
------------------
	1.gst-inspect :	
	-------------
		-->It is tool that prints out information of available gstreamer plugins.
		-->It also prints information about a particular element.
		-->When "gst-inspect" is run without any argument, it will print list of plugins and elements.
	
		Examples:
			gst-inspect filesrc
			gst-inspect sink

	2.gst-launch :
	------------
		-->It is a tool that buids and run basic gtreamer pipeline.
			
	3.gst-launch playbin uri=file:///path.mp4

What is a Bin ?
-----------------
-->A Bin is a container for collection of elements.

-->Bins are allow you to combine a group of linked elements into one logical element.

-->You donot deal with individual element anymore, but with just one element the bin.

-->A pipeline is a special subpipe of a bin, that allows execution of all of its contained child elements.

What is a Cap ?
-----------
-->Cap is nothing but "Light weight ref counted object" describing media types.
	caps = media_types + set of properties.

-->Caps(capabilities) of a pad specify what kind of information can travel through the pad
	Ex:	1.rgb video with resolution of 320*200 pixels and 30 frames/sec
		2.16 bits per sample audio, 5.1 channels at 44100 sample/sec
		3.compressed formats like mp3, h264.

-->A single pad can support multiple capabilities .
	Ex: A vidoe sink can support video in different types of format.
            Rgb, yuv, ....

-->Capabilities can specify in ranges.
	Ex: Audio sink can support sample rates from 1-48000 samples/sec.

what is Negotiation ?
-------------------
-->Inorder for to elements to be linked together they must share common set of capabilities, otherwise they could not understand each other

-->Negotiation  is a process in which 2 linked pads agree on a common type and thus the capabilities of pad becomes fixed.

What is Properties ?
------------------
-->The properties is the primary and most important way of controlling how an element behaves.

-->Plugins provide additional properties to provide more information about thier configuration how to configure the element
	gst-inspect is useful tool to query the property of a particular element.


How to create a pipeline ?
------------------------

	gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! autovideosink
	
   To change pattern :
   ----------------
	gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc pattern=snow ! autovideosink
