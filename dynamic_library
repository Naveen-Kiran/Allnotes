Dynamic library:
--------------

Object file comes in 3 flavors:

	1.Relocatable

	2.Executable

	3.Shared

	Reloacatable object files :
	-------------------------
	It contains Code and Data in a form which can be combined with other Object-files at Linking time to create an Executable.

	Executable object files:
	-----------------------
	It contains Binary code and Data in a form which can be copies into memory and execute.

	Shared object files :
	--------------------
	These are the object files which can be loaded into memory and linked dynamically at either Load/Run time by a linker.

	Shared libraries are loaded into memory by the programs when they started.

	when a shared library is loaded into memory properly, then all programs that start later automatically uses already loaded shared lib.

	Steps to create Dynamic library :
	---------------------------------
		1. create object files and pass -fPIC to generate "position independent" code.
				
 					gcc -c -fPIC *.c 
		
			Position Independent code means that the generated machine code is not dependent on being located at a specific address 		       in order to work

			Ex : Jumps would be generated as related rather than absolute 	

		2. To create a shared lib 
				
				 	gcc -shared -o libprint.so *.o 	

		3. To use
					gcc main.c -o main -L. lprint
